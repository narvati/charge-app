Highlight code blocks in Markdown files with [**remark**][remark] and
[**lowlight**][lowlight].

This package integrates with [remark-html][].
It may be better to work with [rehype][], which is specifically made for HTML,
and to use [rehype-highlight][] instead of this package.

## Installation

[npm][]:

```bash
npm install remark-highlight.js
```

## Example

Say we have the following markdown file, `example.md`:

```markdown
~~~css
h1 {
  color: red;
}
~~~
```

And our script, `example.js`, looks as follows:

```javascript
const vfile = require('to-vfile')
const report = require('vfile-reporter')
const unified = require('unified')
const markdown = require('remark-parse')
const html = require('remark-html')
const highlight = require('remark-highlight.js')

unified()
  .use(markdown)
  .use(highlight)
  .use(html)
  .process(vfile.readSync('example.md'), (err, file) => {
    console.error(report(err || file))
    console.log(String(file))
  })
```

Now, running `node example` yields:

```html
example.md: no issues found
<pre><code class="hljs language-css"><span class="hljs-selector-tag">h1</span> {
  <span class="hljs-attribute">color</span>: red;
}</code></pre>
```

## API

### `remark.use(highlight[, options])`

Highlight code blocks in markdown.

For a list of languages that you can pass to these options, see the
[highlight.js documentation][list-of-languages].

#### `options.include`

If this option is defined (`Array`), this plugin will only highlight languages
that _are_ in this list.

#### `options.exclude`

If this option is defined (`Array`), this plugin will only highlight languages
that _are not_ in this list.
